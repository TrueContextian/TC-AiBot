DREL expressions can include special characters like spaces, hyphens, symbols, and punctuation. The following image shows an example of an expression using DREL. References are variables that define the information in the expression. They always have a “%” symbol followed by a letter. Some references have a default property. Example: %u references the last user who submitted a form. This information might be the User ID, Username, or Email, depending on the property. %u without a property returns the user’s Display Name (first and last name and username). Properties specify the information to return for the reference. Place them in brackets [ ] after a reference when you want the system to return a property other than the default, or when the reference doesn't have a default property. Some references can include more than one property. Example: [name] specifies that the user information",
