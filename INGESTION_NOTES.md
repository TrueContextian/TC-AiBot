# Documentation Ingestion Notes

## Issue Encountered

When running `npm run ingest`, the crawler successfully visited 50+ pages but initially saved 0 documents. After fixes, it extracted content from 50 pages but 49 were "404 Page not found" responses.

## Root Cause

The TrueContext documentation site (docs.truecontext.com) appears to have:
1. **Authentication requirements** - Most sub-pages redirect to a login page
2. **Rich homepage** - The main landing page is publicly accessible and contains comprehensive overview content

## Solution

### Improved Crawler ([scripts/ingest.ts](scripts/ingest.ts))
- Added multiple fallback CSS selectors for finding main content
- Added detailed debugging output (title, content length, sections found)
- Reduced MAX_PAGES to 50 for faster iterations
- Added error tracking and summary reporting
- Filters content by minimum length (100 chars) to avoid empty pages

### Post-Processing
After ingestion, run this to remove 404 pages:
```bash
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('data/documents.json', 'utf8'));
const filtered = data.filter(doc => !doc.content.includes('404') && doc.content.length > 200);
fs.writeFileSync('data/documents.json', JSON.stringify(filtered, null, 2));
console.log('Filtered from', data.length, 'to', filtered.length, 'chunks');
"
```

## Current Status

✅ **Successfully extracted 14 high-quality document chunks** containing:

- **Workflow Designers** - Form building, conditional logic, repeatable sections
- **Field Operations Coordinators** - Dispatching, approvals, tracking
- **Data Integration Specialists** - REST API, Salesforce integration, data routing
- **Team Admins** - User management, permissions, FormSpaces
- **Field Tech Experience** - Visual form structure, resources, data sources
- **Workflow Creation** - Conditional logic, multi-modal capture, repeatable sections
- **Form Building Platform** - Form builder, mobile app, workflow organization
- **System Integration** - Data sources, document generation, REST API, pre-built integrations
- **Analytics and Reporting** - Dashboards, basic analytics, advanced analytics
- **Platform Admin** - User management, security, deployment

## Recommendations for Better Coverage

### Option 1: Manual Documentation Collection
Since most pages require authentication, consider:
1. Log in to docs.truecontext.com manually
2. Export documentation as PDFs or HTML
3. Process exported files with the crawler

### Option 2: API Documentation Ingestion
If TrueContext has an API documentation endpoint or sitemap.xml:
1. Use the sitemap to find authenticated documentation URLs
2. Provide authentication credentials to Playwright
3. Crawl with session cookies

### Option 3: Use Alternative Sources
- TrueContext Community Forum
- Knowledge base articles
- Support documentation
- Release notes
- Video transcript summaries

### Option 4: Implement Authentication in Crawler
Add login functionality to [scripts/ingest.ts](scripts/ingest.ts):

```typescript
// Before crawling
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://docs.truecontext.com/login');
await page.fill('#username', process.env.DOCS_USERNAME);
await page.fill('#password', process.env.DOCS_PASSWORD);
await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
await page.waitForNavigation();

// Then start crawling
```

## Current Content Quality

Despite only having homepage content, the 14 chunks provide:
- ✅ High-level platform overview
- ✅ Role-based feature descriptions
- ✅ Core capabilities and use cases
- ✅ Integration options
- ✅ Key terminology and concepts

This is sufficient for:
- Answering general "what is TrueContext" questions
- Explaining major features and capabilities
- Describing different user roles
- Discussing integration approaches

## Testing the Bot

The bot is now functional with the current content. Test with queries like:
- "What is TrueContext?"
- "How do I build forms?"
- "What are the integration options?"
- "Tell me about dispatching and work management"
- "What is the REST API?"

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current bot** to ensure it works with existing content
2. **Determine content coverage needs** - What questions should it answer?
3. **Choose expansion strategy** - Manual export, authentication, or alternative sources
4. **Iterate on crawler** if authentication is provided
5. **Consider hybrid approach** - Combine documentation with knowledge base, tutorials, etc.
